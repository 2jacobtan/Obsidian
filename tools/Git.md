Gitk
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/gitk

> Gitk is a graphical repository browser. It was the first of its kind. It can be thought of as a GUI wrapper for [git log](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-log). It is useful for exploring and visualizing the history of a repository. It’s written in tcl/tk which makes it portable across operating systems. `gitk` is maintained by Paul Mackerras as an independent project, separate from Git core. Stable versions are distributed as part of the Git suite for the convenience of end users. Gitk can be a helpful learning aid for newcomers to Git.

> Git is hard: screwing up is easy, and figuring out how to fix your mistakes is fucking impossible. Git documentation has this chicken and egg problem where you can't search for how to get yourself out of a mess, _unless you already know the name of the thing you need to know about_ in order to fix your problem.

On undoing, fixing, or removing commits in git

> This document is an attempt to be a fairly comprehensive guide to recovering from what you did not mean to do when using git. It isn't that git is so complicated that you need a large document to take care of your particular problem, it is more that the set of things that you might have done is so large that different techniques are needed depending on exactly what you have done and what you want to have happen.
