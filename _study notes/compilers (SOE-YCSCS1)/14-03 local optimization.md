constant folding

\
remove unreachable code
- possibly faster program
  + memory cache effects
  + increased spatial locality

\
algebraic optimization

\
single assignment form (i.e. no mutation)
- common sub-expression elimination
- copy propagation
	+ constant propagation
- dead code elimination
