###deterministic finite automaton (DFA)

- at most one transition per character per state
- no epsilon transition

(DFA is a special case of NFA)

###non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA)

- may have more than one transition per character per state
- may have epsilon transition(s)

(NFA can be converted to DFA)
