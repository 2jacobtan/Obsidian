Status anxiety afflicts almost everyone. And salary / job title are the most easily recognised status symbols.

> University of Amsterdam researchers report that in cultures where there is a profound gulf between haves and have-nots, as in many Western countries, the background hum of status anxiety is [more intense](http://www.gini-research.org/system/uploads/546/original/90.pdf). The fear—an all-too-understandable one—is that any status loss will involve a precipitous drop, emotional as well as financial.

> Our hunger for worldly status, now as in the past, is rooted in our tendency to value other people’s opinion of us more highly than our opinion of ourselves. The most dogged status-seekers, [observes](https://drhurd.com/2014/05/22/46112/) Delaware psychologist Michael Hurd, have a strong “external locus of control”—a belief that the world revolves around what others think of them, rather than what is objectively true or valuable.

> ## When status-seeking becomes irrational
> 
> It’s healthy to feel like you’re productive and making a worthwhile contribution to society. In that case, you might acquire status as a natural result of your commitment to something larger than yourself.

> However, playing the status game—in other words, staking your self-worth on how others view you—is ultimately self-defeating, as a large body of research shows. Tirelessly pursuing high status is associated with a number of [adverse health outcomes](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cracking-the-popularity-code/?WT.mc_id=SA_TW_MB_NEWS), including aggression, addiction, and depression. “If status is your primary goal,” Hurd [writes](https://drhurd.com/2014/05/22/46112/), “you’ll be unhappy without it and you’ll be unhappy once you acquire it.”

> Another problem with status obsession, as the admissions fiasco proves, is that it can entice you to stray from your deepest values. When someone else’s assessment of you—or of your children, perhaps as an extension of you—matters more than your own assessment of yourself, you’ll be all too ready to sacrifice the latter on the altar of the former.
