> ## 8.3.Â Finding Type Errors
> 
> Finding type errors in grammar files is inherently difficult because the code for reductions is moved around before being placed in the parser. We currently have no way of passing the original filename and line numbers to the Haskell compiler, so there is no alternative but to look at the parser and match the code to the grammar file. An info file (generated by the `-i` option) can be helpful here.

> `-i`\[_`file`_\], `--info`\[\=_`file`_\]

> Directs Happy to produce an info file containing detailed information about the grammar, parser states, parser actions, and conflicts. Info files are vital during the debugging of grammars. The filename argument is optional (note that there's no space between `-i` and the filename in the short version), and if omitted the info file will be written to _`file`_`.info` (where _`file`_ is the input file name with any extension removed).
