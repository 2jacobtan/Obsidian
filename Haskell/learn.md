> This Haskell tutorial is based on the 2016 installment of the [CIS194 Haskell course at the University of Pennsylvania](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis194/fall16/), and encompasses the first four lectures. What’s interesting about sessions is that they start teaching the very basics of Haskell using the [CodeWorld](https://code.world/haskell) online programming environment, so you can get started right away.
> 
> I have moved these lectures here partly because the CodeWorld API changes over time, so some of the examples on the CIS194 website stopped working. This only affects lectures 1–4, so if after working through the present document, you can right away start with [lecture 5 (“Real World Haskell”)](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis194/fall16/lectures/05-real-world-haskell.html). But before that, enjoy this introduction.
> 
> This material was inspired by and builds on the content of the previous installments for the CIS194 courses, held by Brent Yorgey, Richard Eisenberg and Noam Zilberstein. You can view [the source on GitHub](https://github.com/nomeata/haskell-via-sokoban/) of this document, and submit improvements there.

I used this successfully to learn Foldable, Traversable, and Monad Transformers.
