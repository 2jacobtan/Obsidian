> We try to get rid of the complexity, control it, and seek simplicity. I think framing things that way is misguided. Complexity has to live somewhere.

> One thing Resilience Engineering has taught me is the concept of [Requisite Variety](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/REQVAR.html) from cybernetics: only complexity can handle complexity.

> When dealing with build tools, a few things become apparent:
> 
> -   if you make the build tool simple, it won't handle all the weird edge cases that exist out there
> -   if you want to handle the weird edge cases, you need to deviate from whatever norm you wanted to establish
> -   if you want ease of use for common defaults, the rules for common defaults must be shared between the tool and the users, who shape their systems to fit the tool's expectations
> -   if you allow configuration or scripting, you give the users a way to specify the rules that must be shared, so the tool fits their systems
> -   if you want to keep the tool simple, you have to force your users to only play within the parameters that fit this simplicity
> -   if your users' use cases don't map well to your simplicity, they will build shims around your tool to attain their objectives

> This cannot be avoided. Complexity _has_ to live somewhere. It's always a part of people solving problems, whether you realize it or not.
