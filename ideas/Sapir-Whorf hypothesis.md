Actually, having thoughts that you cannot express in words is a direct counterexample to **Strong** Sapir-Whorf. You're able to think far more than what the language allows you to express. **Strong** Sapir-Whorf says that you can only think as much as the language can express.

Ironically, feeling the visceral impact of a programming language's restriction on thought is actually a counterexample to **Strong** Sapir-Whorf. You feel restricted because you are \_able\_ to do more but are simply not \_allowed\_ to.

> ### 4.4 Strong and weak Whorfianism
> 
> One of the first linguists to defend a general form of universalism against linguistic relativism, thus presupposing that they conflict, was Julia Penn (1972). She was also an early popularizer of the distinction between ‘strong’ and ‘weak’ formulations of the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis (and an opponent of the ‘strong’ version).
> 
> ‘Weak’ versions of Whorfianism state that language _influences_ or defeasibly shapes thought. ‘Strong’ versions state that language _determines_ thought, or fixes it in some way. The weak versions are commonly dismissed as banal (because of course there must be _some_ influence), and the stronger versions as implausible.
> 
> The weak versions are considered banal because they are not adequately formulated as testable hypotheses that could conflict with relevant evidence about language and thought.
> 
> Why would the strong versions be thought implausible? For a language to make us think in a particular way, it might seem that it must at least temporarily prevent us from thinking in other ways, and thus make some thoughts not only inexpressible but unthinkable. If this were true, then strong Whorfianism would conflict with the Katzian effability claim. There would be thoughts that a person couldn’t think because of the language(s) they speak.
> 
> Some are fascinated by the idea that there are inaccessible thoughts; and the notion that learning a new language gives access to entirely new thoughts and concepts seems to be a staple of popular writing about the virtues of learning languages. But many scientists and philosophers intuitively rebel against violations of effability: thinking about concepts that no one has yet named is part of their job description.
> 
> The resolution lies in seeing that the language could _affect certain aspects of our cognitive functioning without making certain thoughts unthinkable for us_.
