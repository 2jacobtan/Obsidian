I saw a poorly thought out tweet (with many likes) that caused me to write him off as a charlatan.

He tweeted about a "clever" technique to get people to give each of your ideas a single-digit numerical rating. Then instead of taking the average rating of each idea, take the max (or something like that; memory fuzzy), cuz supposedly the ones that got at least some high ratings suggest that some people saw the brilliance in the idea, which others overlooked.

Which is dumb because it could also be that some people saw the stupidity of the idea, which others overlooked. 

And also absolutely retarded that he'd reduce people's valuable feedback to a number.

(I suppose the tweet was so bad he eventually deleted it in shame.)
