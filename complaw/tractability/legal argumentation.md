An enlightening article on the work of (and necessity of) a human lawyer in constructing an interpretation / theory of the facts of the case and relevant legal rules / principles, in a way that favours their client.

Then the judge / jury has to form a final interpretation / theory to apply to the case.

The real world is complex and messy. So that, often (especially the cases that go to court) there is a "penumbra of doubt" which cannot be resolved by computers (unless we achieve artificial general intelligence).

The rules can be deliberately vague, and be more like general principles to be weighed against each other (not clear-cut rules).

It takes human minds with their comprehensive understanding of the real world, to argue for their preferred "reasonable" interpretations.

The law is also continually changing, and lawyers are the ones closely following the changes and contemplating the potential consequences.

(I.e. lawyers who are good at the above-mentioned kinds of work, are not getting replaced any time soon.)

That said, there are regulations and contracts with clear rules, that are highly suited for computational methods.
