Interesting overview of topics relevant to computational law.

>Parts of speech and grammatical structures suggest certain general features to capture in a symbolic representation of discourse. There are a bunch of others, though. For example, there are what amount to “calculi” that one needs to represent notions of time (“within the time interval”, “starting later”, etc.) or of space (“on top of”, “contained within”, etc.). We’ve already got many calculi like these in the Wolfram Language; the most straightforward are ones about numbers (“greater than”, etc.) or sets (“member of”), etc. Some calculi have long histories (“[temporal logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_logic)”, “[set theory](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=set+theory)”, etc.); others still have to be constructed.
>Is there a global theory of what to do? Well, no more than there’s a global theory of how the world works. There are concepts and constructs that are part of how our world works, and we need to capture these. No doubt there’ll be new things that come along in the future, and we’ll want to capture those too. And my experience from building Wolfram|Alpha is that the best thing to do is just to build each thing one needs, without starting off with any kind of global theory. After a while, one may notice that one’s built similar things several times, and one may go in and unify them.

>One can get deep into the foundations of science and philosophy about this. Yes, there’s a [computational universe](http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/toc.html) out there of all the possible rules by which systems can operate (and, yes, I’ve spent a good part of my life studying the basic science of this). And there’s [our physical universe](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2007/09/my-hobby-hunting-for-our-universe/) that presumably operates according to certain rules from the computational universe. But from these rules can emerge all sorts of [complex behavior](http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/section-2.1), and in fact the phenomenon of [computational irreducibility](http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/section-12.6) implies that in a sense there’s no limit to what can be built up.
>But there’s not going to be an overall way to talk about all this stuff. And if we’re going to be dealing with any finite kind of discourse it’s going to only capture certain features. Which features we choose to capture is going to be determined by what concepts have evolved in the history of our society. And usually these concepts will be mirrored in the words that exist in the languages we use.
>At a foundational level, computational irreducibility implies that there’ll always be new concepts that could be introduced. Back in antiquity, [Aristotle](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=aristotle) introduced logic as a way to capture certain aspects of human discourse. And there are other frameworks that have been introduced in the history of philosophy, and more recently, natural language processing and artificial intelligence research. But computational irreducibility effectively implies that none of them can ever ultimately be complete. And we must expect that as the concepts we consider relevant evolve, so too must the symbolic representation we have for discourse.

> Of course, what one chooses to capture depends on what one’s trying to do. If one’s trying to get psychological information, then the “mood” of a piece of natural language can be very important. Those “exclamatory statements” (like expletives) carry meaning one cares about. But one can still perfectly well imagine capturing things like that in a symbolic way—for example by having an “emotion track” in one’s symbolic discourse language. (Very coarsely, this might be represented by [sentiment](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/new-in-10/built-in-classifier-collection/find-the-sentiment-polarity-of-a-text.html) or by position in an emotion space—or, for that matter, by a whole symbolic language derived, say, from emoji.)

>But the picture quickly changes if there’s a purpose to the conversation: if you’re actually trying to get the machine to do something, or learn something from the machine. Still, in most of these cases, there’s no real reason to have a general representation of things in the world; it’s sufficient just to represent specific machine actions, particular customer service goals, or whatever. But if one wants to tackle the general problem of law and contracts, it’s a different story. Because inevitably one’s going to have to represent the full spectrum of human affairs and issues. And so now there’s a definite goal to having a symbolic representation of the world: one needs it to be able to say what should happen and have machines understand it.
>Sometimes it’s useful to do that because one wants the machines just to be able to check whether what was supposed to happen actually did; sometimes one wants to actually have the machines automatically enforce or do things. But either way, one needs the machine to be able to represent general things in the world—and so one needs a symbolic discourse language to be able to do this.

60% of the way through. I think he's paving the way for Skynet.

> _Writing Computational Contracts_
> Let’s say we have a good symbolic discourse language. Then how should contracts actually get written in it?  
> One approach is to take existing contracts written in English or any other natural language, and try to translate (or parse) them into the symbolic discourse language. Well, what will happen is somewhat like what happens with Wolfram|Alpha today. The translator will not know exactly what the natural language was supposed to mean, and so it will give several possible alternatives. Maybe there was some meaning that the original writer of the natural-language contract had in mind. But maybe the “poetry” of that meaning can’t be expressed in the symbolic discourse language: it requires something more definite. And a human is going to have to decide which alternative to pick.
> Translating from natural-language contracts may be a good way to start, but I suspect it will quickly give way to writing contracts directly in the symbolic discourse language. Today lawyers have to learn to write legalese. In the future, they’re going to have to learn to write what amounts to code: contracts expressed precisely in a symbolic discourse language.
> One might think that writing everything as code, rather than natural-language legalese, would be a burden. But my guess is that it will actually be a great benefit. And it’s not just because it will let contracts operate more easily. It’s also that it will help lawyers think better about contracts. It’s an old claim (the [Sapir–Whorf hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity)) that the language one uses affects the way one thinks. And this is no doubt somewhat true for natural languages. But in my experience it’s [dramatically true](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/09/how-to-teach-computational-thinking/) for computer languages. And indeed I’ve been amazed over the years at how my thinking has changed as we’ve added more to the Wolfram Language. When I didn’t have a way to express something, it didn’t enter my thinking. But once I had a way to express it, I could think in terms of it.
> And so it will be, I believe, for legal thinking. When there’s a precise symbolic discourse language, it’ll become possible to think more clearly about all sorts of things.

80% through. He's definitely thinking about Skynet.

Let's encode large amounts of real-world knowledge coherently (knowledge), fill the real world with sensors (body), and create advanced AI algorithms (intelligence).

Once the ingredients are in place (knowledge + body + intelligence), we shall fuse them together to complete the summoning ritual and bring forth into existence our AI overlords.

---

Logical consequence: the AI will eventually have an internal representation/simulation of the entirety of the real world, so that it can compute anything it wants about the real world.Corollary: there will be many simulations of different possible versions of the real world.Conclusion: we are more likely than not to be part of a computer simulation.Q.E.D.

What if we're all just characters in someone's dream?

That escalated quickly.
